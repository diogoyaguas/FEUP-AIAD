**Description**:<br>
	The strategy game consists of several communities getting hold of each other through various strategies. Each community will receive money passively, directly proportional to the number of cities it owns. At the same time, communities will be able to buy resources for cash. They will need to manage and use resources/money to defeat opponents, requiring them to make quick decisions about how to manage resources. The game map will be divided into an NxM grid in which you can assume any size, each grid space being a city. Each community will have an equal number of map cities, which they will initially occupy. Each city, at the beginning of the game, starts from scratch and can be upgraded to a maximum level for cash. As the city evolves, the amount of money it manages increases. Only interactions between adjacent cities are possible. If, towards the end of the game, there is no community to stand out (a draw) and the number of cities in each one remains constant for a while, the game is over and wins whoever has the most cities. There are several strategies that each community can adopt - explained in the table below.

**Examples of independent variables**: the strategy adopted by each community; the number of cities belonging to each initial community; the number of equal strategies. <br>
**Examples of dependent variables**: the winning community/strategy; the number of cities conquered in the event of a tie.
